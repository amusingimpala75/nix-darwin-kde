* ~nix-darwin-kde~
This is an attempt at being able to compile the KDE apps on with ~nix-darwin~.

- Currently "working" applications:
  - [X] Dolphin
    - [ ] Weird scrolling
    - [ ] Sometimes won't open folder or will segfault
  - [X] KCalc
    - [ ] Colors are weird

"Working" can mean a lot of things. Some of these may just segfault or have weird colors.

There definitely has to be a better/cleaner way to set up the overlay, but I'm just going to leave this here as it works well enough.
